# Event Sourcing Example
This is a small implementation of Event Sourcing working on the provided interfaces of the Protects project by Buttercup.

You can play with the different commands or add a few yourselves to get a glimpse of how a request is handled with event sourcing.

This is really basic structure but meant for small presentations to explain the basics of Event Sourcing.
